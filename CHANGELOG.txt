0.2.0 Modifications for preview feature of STW

- shrinkthewebimage template tag is NOT backward compatible with version 0.0.1.
The alt argument is no longer accepted.
- shrinkthewebimage template tag is now designed for use by free accounts, it
adds the required preview feature. It can also be used by PRO accounts wanting
the preview functionality. The tag now accepts key-value arguments in the same
manner as the stwimage tag.
- stwimage can now only be used for PRO features.
- template tags now throw exceptions in their constructors instead of in the render
function so configuration errors are visible during development.
- django-stw defines a key 'lang' for the SHRINK_THE_WEB dictionary that
can be passed along as a default to the preview tag. Alternately a 'lang'
keyword can be supplied in each template tag invocation. django-stw defaults it
to 'en'.
